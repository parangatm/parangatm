### About Me

I am a MS student at [UCLA](https://www.ucla.edu/), studying Electrical and Computer Engineering with a focus on Computer Architecture.

My interests lie in the field of Computer Architecture, particularly Hardware-Software Co-Design and Recofigurable Logic Design. I love to read and work on anything related to RISC-V. I am looking to build a career along the same lines.

### About Me

I am a first year MS student at [UCLA](https://www.ucla.edu/), studying Electrical and Computer Engineering with a focus on Computer Architecture. I worked with [Qualcomm](https://www.qualcomm.com/) India as a PD Timing Engineer for two years, working on different Snapdragon Mobile and Computer chipsets. I earned my bachelors degree in Electronics and Communication Engineering from [Delhi Technological University](http://www.dtu.ac.in/) in 2021.

My interests lie in the field of Computer Architecture, particularly Hardware-Software Co-Design and Recofigurable Logic Design. I love to read and work on anything related to RISC-V. I am looking to build a career along the same lines.
